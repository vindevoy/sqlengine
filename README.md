# SQLEngine

This engine is my personal, biased attempt to simplify the way you do CRUD with SQLAlchemy.

I attempt to hide the complexity of creating an engine and a session to the user of this engine.

## Purpose

I have created this engine for my students Python.  This code is not production-ready.  
It should be used as an example on how to work with SQLAlchemy and make smarter classes.
